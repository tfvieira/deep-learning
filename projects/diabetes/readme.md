# Diabetes Classification
The ```diabetes.csv``` dataset contains 768 entries (rows) and 9 columns (8 features and a class) of different individuals. The classes are:
- **0**: for instances that did not develop diabetes.
- **1**: for samples with diabetes.

# Objective
Train a Logistic Regression classifier to predict whether and individual is likely to develop diabetes based on the corresponding 8 features.

# Requirements

## Pre-processing and visualization
1. Apply an adequate feature pre-processing.
1. Visualize dataset's statistics (histograms, boxplot to evaluate outliers, missing values, etc).

## Train a first classifier
- Use SciKit-Learn Logistic Regression classifier.

## Train a second classifier
1. Use Neural Networks with Tensorflow with a Logistic Regression mindset.
1. Provide training and testing performance curves throughout epochs.
1. Provide the confusion matrix.
1. Provide the ROC curve.
1. **Minimum classification accuracy of 75%**.
